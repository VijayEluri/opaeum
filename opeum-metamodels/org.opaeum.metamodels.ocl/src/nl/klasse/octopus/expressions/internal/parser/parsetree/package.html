Contains the classes representing the parsetree for OCL files.
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
An OCL file, containing OCL expressions, is first translated to a parsetree.
The syntax check done during this stage is rather forgiving. The intention is to allow
as much as reasonably possible and worry about user errors in the next phase: the 
semantical analysis. During analysis more intelligent
errors can be given to the user.
