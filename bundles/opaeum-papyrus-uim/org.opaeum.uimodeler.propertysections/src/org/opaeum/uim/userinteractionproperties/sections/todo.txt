RAP
Set currentRole when opening an entity,starting a task

Eclipse
Take all model modifications out of the transformation so that we can do stuf asynchronously without a transaction
SlotSection: for enum values and boolean slots, default to checkboxes/radio buttons. For these slots, generate the appropriate slot value by default and not ocl expressions. 
Allow the default values  to be overridden to ocl expressions
Some of the synching between slots and their values is not working properly.
Mark the OpaeumEclipseContext when a re-integrate is required, typically when an OJClass is added,removed or renamed  (persistence.xml)
Support contentAssist for AbstractChooesrPropertySection
Restrict typedElement's types to types in scope



Transformation
Make use of Links between instance specifications, useful for compositional enumerations 
Allow properties' fetch early/lazy to be specified

Cube
Generate a cube per schema to allow for classes to be easily configured without server restart (add dimensions and measures)
Remember to generate joins for inheritance
Treat interface ends as enumerations with a kind of powertype enum
Consider introducing filters for axis entries with security contraints
Support enum composition: generate tables for enumerations and populate them all on initialization, don't map enums with hibernate  - generate the sql

Google
Allow a user to synchronize the contact details of a certain businessroleinstance with his/her own contacts on google - do this on a multiselect basis too
When a person updates her own profile, mark it as "user approved" and keep this in mind when synchronizing with people's contact lists


UIEngine
Implement login filter that allows for pluggable logins,or maybe even pluggable login filters as such
Set currentUser and currentRole from filter
Invoke additional property validations ( invariants)
Implement radiogroups
Don't display associationclass properties
Display validation messages from cell editors somewhere
Implement libraries with ui's required
TreeConfiguration - show treeview with checkboxes - hidden,visible,hiddenclasses
Add IgnoredFeatures to UserIntefaceEntryPoint
Implement sourcepopulation constraints on parameters

New Tasks:
UIM:
Disable/enablefields for inheritFRomParent,requires...Ownership etc. drive defaults from UimContentAdapter
Introduce PinNavigationContraint
Introduce logic to keep track of all UmlReferences referring to a uml element;
DEfine an RMI service that takes a bytearray in and updates userinterface resources from it
Add forcedLabelWidth and sameWidth to AbstractPanel
Panels should have an optional panelBinding which resolves to the typedElementthat will define the context of  property expressions of all uimfields and actions on the panel
Introduce FileUploadControl and MultiFile upload control
Let Pages be like Forms with advanced layout only of Panels on it


Simulation:
SimpleDataTypes like dates - introduce FormattedStringValue and use FromStringConversion strategy
Implement propertySheetProvider that displays a property sheet tab per simulation model in the original model
Task durations distributions
Calculate resource availability on a 15 minute basis
Allow a specific simulation model to be associated with the current model and display the relevant simulation settings in the property section of simulated elements
Define InstanceSimulations for actors rather that ActualInstances
Simulationlinker: Calculate appropriate value strategies

TaskManagement
Create a calendar just for opaeum tasks schedule them more accurately than google tasks. Display this calendar in a view
Introduce a "ScheduledTask" (i.e.meetings etc, SLA's etc) for specific date. Calculate latest possible start time for each other task. Show all of these on Google Calendar
Log work done against a task.
