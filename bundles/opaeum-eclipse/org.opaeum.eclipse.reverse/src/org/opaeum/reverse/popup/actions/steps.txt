split into 3 functions:
Reverse engineer normal java
  Do annotations -- later
Reverse engineer profile  
  Check for profile
  Only do annotations and enums
  Do attributes that are annotations as compositional, non association attributes of the type of the annotation 
  Support the "Class" type (with type arguments  -- later)
Reverse engineer JPA
  Import JPA profile
  Do checks for Sets for uniques and (INDEXED arrayLists) for ordered (simply annotate sorted dudes)
  Create a stereotype attribute for imported java code
  Remember Constructors
  
Forward engineer Java code:
  If any javax.persistence annotation is present, skip hibernate and jpa annotators
  Generate stored code for custom methods
  Create an extremely simple attribute implementor
  Remember Constructors
