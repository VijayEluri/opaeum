override the pallette and the propertysections
see if you can allow components to participate in associations 

PropertySections
Responsibility
Tasks - escalations,potential delegates etc.
States - requireRoles - think that through
lookup for typedelements

TaskManagement
Model in Topcased with statemachine
Model OrgUnit and User, but map them to the java interfaces - no dependency from actual models
Model UserInterface too
Implement ports as default interfaces that delegate operations to the containing component. Such invocations would either delegate to users or delegate
to a process (ownedBehaviour of the component)

Operations
CAlculate which operations are long running
All long-running operations should provide a second method providing the calling context
AcceptCallAction - store operation structure
