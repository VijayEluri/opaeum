Refactoring
Make visitors TransformationSteps
Port BehaviorUtil to EmfBehaviorUtil and identify processes and tasks during extraction
Introduce new INakedUmlEmbeddedTask and INakedUmlStandaloneTask

UIM
Put label width on all possible containers of fields
remove fields pointing to obsolete properties
remove operation navigations and action buttons to obsolete operations
remove obsolete forms 
set field label size on layout
allow forms to be reused as panels
migrate table control to swing
Replace column with FieldColumn and ActionColumn, with bindings
Add button bar for actions on multiple rows in the table
Introduce entryScreen concept, allow formpanels to be used

NakedUML Topcased
Operation PArameters - remove visibility and effect
Operation Ocl
Provide action to synchronize a powerType's literals with its powertypeextent
Property Specification
Responsibility propertySection
Tasks - escalations,potential delegates etc.
States - requireRoles - think that through
lookup for typedelements
HTML Text editor for Signal templates
Enumeration Literals and their slots
Property lookup type - all, composition siblings,expression 
Specifications for Behaviors
CreateObjectAction::classifier
isQuery for operations
defaultValue for properties

TaskManagement
Model UserInterface too
Implement ports as default interfaces that delegate operations to the containing component. Such invocations would either delegate to users or delegate
to a process (ownedBehaviour of the component)
Swimlanes WITHOUT property "represents" and task definitions specify potentialOwners, Swimlanes WITH property "represents" and Target pins specify actual owners.
Swimlanes with Classifier Represents and no potential Owners will use ClassifierX.allInstance() for POTENTIAL owners 
Create one task per value in targetElement expression
Remember that Responsibilities implemented as STateMachines are TaskObjects, not OperationProcessObjects

Operations
Calculate which operations are long running
All long-running operations should provide a second method providing the calling context
AcceptCallAction - store operation structure
unmarshall the pins to allow OCL compilation for postconditions

Processes
Implement effects, entry and do-action subprocess calls
Implement history state
Implement transition across state boundaries
IMplement real asynchronous actions
Log all events as well as asynchronous actions directly in database and deliver them asynchronously

MAven
put MavenArtefatId in profile
default MAvenArtifactIdPrefix to worskpaceidentifier-modelName
programmaticallyset m2_repo

Validation
ModelNameUniqueness
Asynchronous actions cannot have outputs
