Model in Topcased with statemachine
Model OrgUnit and User, but map them to the java interfaces - no dependency from actual models
Model UserInterface too
Implement ports as default interfaces that delegate operations to the containing component. Such invocations would either delegate to users or delegate
to a process (ownedBehaviour of the component)

Operations
Calculate which operations are long running
All long-running operations should provide a second method providing the calling context
AcceptCallAction - store operation structure
unmarshall the pins to allow OCL compilation for postconditions
