Refactoring
Port BehaviorUtil to EmfBehaviorUtil and identify processes and tasks during extraction

UIM
Put label width on all possible containers of fields
Row height on uimColumnLayout
remove fields pointing to obsolete properties
remove operation navigations and action buttons to obsolete operations
remove obsolete forms 
allow forms to be reused as panels
migrate table control to swing
Add button bar for actions on multiple rows in the table
Introduce entryScreen concept, allow formpanels to be used
Introduce ocl expressions for things such as lookups and allowedRoles

TaskManagement
Model UserInterface too
Implement ports as default interfaces that delegate operations to the containing component. Such invocations would either delegate to users or delegate
to a process (ownedBehaviour of the component)
Swimlanes WITHOUT property "represents" and task definitions specify potentialOwners, Swimlanes WITH property "represents" and Target pins specify actual owners.
Swimlanes with Classifier Represents and no potential Owners will use ClassifierX.allInstance() for POTENTIAL owners 
Create one task per value in targetElement expression
Remember that Responsibilities implemented as STateMachines are TaskObjects, not OperationProcessObjects

Operations
Calculate which operations are long running
All long-running operations should provide a second method providing the calling context
AcceptCallAction - store operation structure
unmarshall the pins to allow OCL compilation for postconditions

Statemachines
Implement effects, entry and do-action subprocess calls
Implement history state
Implement transition across state boundaries
Implement state invariants

Classes
Generalizationsets
PowerTypes
link powerTypeInstances with generalization

Activities
Implement real asynchronous actions, i.e. call the action in another physical thread
Log all events as well as asynchronous actions and signals directly in database and deliver them asynchronously

Maven
put MavenArtefatId in profile
default MAvenArtifactIdPrefix to worskpaceidentifier-modelName
programmaticallyset m2_repo

Validation
ModelNameUniqueness
Asynchronous actions cannot have outputs

Runtime
For BusinessComponent instances, add a property called LDAP Identifier which associates that instance with an ldap entry
On login, check ldap query for logged in user and take the user through a wizard adding a businessrole instance for every potential role where the user also belongs to the businesscomponentinstance
For ocl expressions from uim - use Javassist to generate expressions at runtime, including common composite logic
For preconditions on operations that do NOT refer to parameters, disable the operationNavigation or action if it evaluates to false
For preconditions of transitions that do NOT refer to event parameters, disable the associated operationNaviation/actionButton if it evualuates to false
For notification templates, isolate velocity statements and remove empty containing nodes from treee
For notications templates, repeat rows if table contained in a foreach
