Some notes on code generation.

1) User/Role generation
	Roles are represented by interfaces.
	Interfaces become roles by having a dependency on an Actor.
	Concrete classes then realize the role interfaces.
	NameSpaceExtractor.java is responsible for checking whether the interfaces represents a user, i.e. has a dependency on an Actor
	UserRepresentationCalculator.java in turn makes the concrete classes that realize the interfaces represent the user.
