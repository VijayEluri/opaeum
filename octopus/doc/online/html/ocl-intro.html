</h2>


<p>
  <a name="1002561"> </a><font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Object Constraint Language</i></font> (OCL) is a<font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b> </b></font>modeling language with which you can build software models. It is defined as a standard "add-on" to the Unified Modeling Language (UML), the Object Management Group (OMG) standard for object-oriented analysis and design. Every expression written in OCL relies on the types (i.e., the classes, interfaces, and so on) that are defined in the UML diagrams. The use of OCL therefore includes the use of at least some aspects of UML.</font>
</p>


<p>
  <a name="1002562"> </a><font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Expressions written in OCL add vital information to object-oriented models and other object modeling artifacts. This information often cannot be expressed in a diagram. In UML 1.1, this information was thought to be limited to constraints, where a <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>constraint</i></font> is defined as a restriction on one or more values of (part of) an object-oriented model or system. In UML 2, the understanding is that far more additional information should be included in a model than constraints alone. Defining queries, referencing values, or stating conditions and business rules in a model are all accomplished by writing expressions. OCL is the standard language in which these expressions can be written in a clear and unambiguous manner.</font>
</p>


<p>
  <a name="1002589"> </a><font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OCL expressions are particularly useful, as they allow a developer to create a highly specific set of rules that govern the aspects of an individual object. As many software projects today require unique and complex rules that are written specifically for business models, OCL is becoming an integral facet of object development.</font>
</p>


<p>
  <a name="1002563"> </a><font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recently, a new version of OCL, version 2.0, has been formally defined in the <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Object Constraint Language Specification</i></font><font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font>and as such it has been adopted by the <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</a></font>. Take a look at the book `<font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.klasse.nl/english/boeken/ocl-intro.html">The Object Constraint Language, Second Edition'</a></font> by Jos Warmer and Anneke Kleppe for a more informal explanation of this version of the language<font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. </font>Octopus complies to this version of the standard. </font>
