<p>
  <a name="1002550"> </a><font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The visual language Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a collaborative product of a large group of companies. UML is a standard that was developed by leading technologists in the object oriented world, as an answer to a `request for proposals' of the <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="http://www.omg.org">Object Management Group</a></font> (OMG). </font>
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="1002552"> </a><font color="#003366"  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The origin of UML</font>
</h3>


<p>
  <a name="1002553"> </a><font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the start of the nineties the first object oriented systems development methods were being published. Among those the Object Modeling Technique (OMT), as developed by Jim Rumbaugh et al., the method developed by Grady Booch, and Ivar Jacobson's OOSE method have been very popular. They decided to merge their methods, and submitted the result as a proposal to the request for proposals that the OMG issued at the time.</font>
</p>


<p>
  <a name="1002554"> </a><font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Together with five other submitters they worked on a final submission that was accepted as the standard by the OMG in September 1997. One of the additions to the original UML proposal was the Object Constraint Language (OCL), which was part of the IBM/ObjecTime proposal.</font>
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="1002555"> </a><font color="#003366"  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A language, not a method</font>
</h3>


<p>
  <a name="1002556"> </a><font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UML is not a method, it does not prescribe how people should work. The only thing that is standardized by UML are the work products (diagrams, etc.) that should be produced.</font>
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="1002557"> </a><font color="#003366"  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The diagrams</font>
</h3>


<p>
  <a name="1002558"> </a><font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">UML offers a wide variety of diagrams. Together they can be used to develop a model of a software system.</font>
</p>

<ul>
  <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><li><a name="1002559"> </a>The use-case diagram shows how the system can be used by external actors, like e.g. human beings.</font>
  <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><li><a name="1002560"> </a>The class diagram shows the static structure of the software system using classes and their relationships.</font>
  <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><li><a name="1002561"> </a>The object diagram shows the static structure of the software system using objects (or instances) and their relationships.</font>
  <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><li><a name="1002562"> </a>The sequence diagram shows the order in time of messages send between the various objects in the system.</font>
  <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><li><a name="1002563"> </a>The collaboration diagram shows how a group of object collaborate to accomplish a goal.</font>
  <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><li><a name="1002564"> </a>The state diagram shows the states which one object can be found in during its lifetime.</font>
  <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><li><a name="1002565"> </a>The activity diagram shows activities that are being performed by (part of) the system, including potential parallelism.</font>
  <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><li><a name="1002566"> </a>The component diagram shows the division of the complete system in separate components, including the relationships between the components.</font>
  <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><li><a name="1002567"> </a>The deployment diagram shows how software components are deployed in a certain hardware configuration.</font>
</ul>

<p>
  <a name="1002568"> </a><font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Apart from the diagrams UML offers a textual language that can be used to specify conditions and rules in the diagrams. This language is called the <font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="ocl.html">Object Constraint Language</a></font> (OCL). </font>
