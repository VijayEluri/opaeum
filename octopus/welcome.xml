	title="Octopus: an OCL Tool for Precise UML Specifications">
<intro>The Octopus tool, created by Klasse Objecten, provides support for working with
OCL expressions in a UML model. OCL expressions provide extra information that cannot 
be expressed in the diagrams that constitute the UML model.</intro>

<item><b>Creating an Octopus project</b>
To create a project in which the full functionality of the Octopus tool can be used, 
open the new project wizard in the category Octopus and follow the directions.</item>

<item><b>Creating a UML model </b>
A UML model can be created by providing a number of text files that contain the model 
information. These files can be generated from a UML case tool or can be created by hand.
A dedicated editor is provided. More info can be found in <topic id="/nl.klasse.octopus/doc/online/html/tutorial.html">Octopus User Guide >Getting Started </topic></item>

<item><b>Using the OCL editor </b>
The heart of an Octopus project lies in the files that contain the OCL expressions.
Each file with extension .ocl is considered to contain OCL expressions and can be changed
using the dedicated OCL editor. Saving the file will cause Octopus to check all expressions 
it contains.</item>

<item><b>Using the Model View </b>
You can see the UML model associated with the project in a window called 'Model View'.
It shows the UML model associated with the currently selected project in a tree structure. 
This tree also contains elements that have been added to the model through OCL expressions
in any of the .ocl files. You can open the Model View by clicking on the Octopus icon in 
the navigator view.</item>
