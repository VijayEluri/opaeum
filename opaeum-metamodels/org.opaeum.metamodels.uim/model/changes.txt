QueryInvocationEditor: remember to open new page for every query submission
Make UserInterface elements and diagrams available in UML treeview - configure different UserInterfaceRoots as artificial Features
Open BehaviorEditor/ReponsibilityViewer on completion of invocation wizard - resultPage for OperationInvocationWizard is low priority
Allow tasks to be created on the propertyNode of a user role in the containment tree, i.e. display TaskInvocationWizard menu item on the propertyNode, but only if  
the set represented by that property is non-empty. These menu items should only be available to users who also play a part in the same BusinessComponent. External users
can only invoke tasks through Responsibilities. In those cases the the menu item would be available on the portNode
Implement property section for "ignoredElements" - automatically remove all representing elements from the uiRoot, also remove them from all ObjectSelectors' available choices
Implement LabelOverrides propertyTab
Add propertySection "representedElement" for pages and panels
BehaviorButton, like OperationButton
org.opaeum.uim.util.ControlUtil.getAllowedControlKinds(UserInterfaceRoot, TypedElement, boolean) - factor in readOnly,pin,param,create,etc, or introduce readOnly property to UimField
