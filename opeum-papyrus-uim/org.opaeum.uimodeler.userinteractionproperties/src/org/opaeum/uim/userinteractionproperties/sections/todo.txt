Cube
UIM
In UIM, model a cube query/report metamodel (use uuids not names), Query,VisibilityConstraint, rowAxis, columnAxis, measureAxis, 
Drag and drop axisEntries onto the row or column axis compartments
Display available dimensions and levels in a tree and allow the user to select one
CubeQueryCubeSection - lookup a classifier in future it could be operations and actions too
AxisEntryDimensionBinding section = display dimension in selected cube
AxisEntryLevelProperty section = display property with dimension

Runtime:
Build up Mondrian queries using the uim model
Add filter items on axis for the current selected object where a dimension appear on which the current object features
Consider introducing filters for axis entries with security contraints



UIEngine
Invoke additional property validations ( invariants)
Implement radiogroups
Don't display associationclass properties
Display validation messages from cell editors somewhere
Implement libraries with ui's required
TreeConfiguration - show treeview with checkboxes - hidden,visible,hiddenclasses
Add IgnoredFeatures to UserIntefaceEntryPoint
Implement sourcepopulation constraints on parameters

New Tasks:
UIM:
DEfine an RMI service that takes a bytearray in and updates userinterface resources from it
Add RadioButtons and checkbox lists as control kinds, include their layout in the orientation
Add a "lastlinkedumlresource" to the modelroot to allow open editors to be reassociated with their uml models
Implement the semantics around the "underUserControl" field
Introduce an action that automatically creates an operation popup from a button
Drag and drop uml items from a tree (properties, actions) 
Add forcedLabelWidth and sameWidth to AbstractPanel
Synchronize uim models on save, apply the underUserControl rules
Apply security to add actions on treeview

Simulation:
SimpleDataTypes like dates - introduce FormattedStringValue and use FromStringConversion strategy
Implement propertySheetProvider that displays a property sheet tab per simulation model in the original model
Task durations distributions
Calculate resource availability on a 15 minute basis
Allow a specific simulation model to be associated with the current model and display the relevant simulation settings in the property section of simulated elements
